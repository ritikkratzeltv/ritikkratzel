        <h1>The Journey: </h1>
        <p>I set out on an ambitious adventure to skateboard across India, covering approximately 4,000 kilometers from
            Leh to Kanyakumari. This journey began on January 1st and took 90 days, with me reaching my destination on
            March 30th, just 10 days ahead of my initial target. After completing my journey from Manali to Kanyakumari,
            I skated from Leh to Manali, completing a total of 100 days on the road. Skateboarding from the northern
            mountains of Manali to the southern tip of India became a dream I was determined to accomplish.</p>
            <h1>The Inception: </h1>
            <p>Skateboarding wasn’t something I did professionally, but it had always been a part of my daily routine growing up in the hilly region of Manali. I would skateboard 5 kilometers in a day to school and back, and over time, it became something I truly enjoyed. This sparked the idea of a larger journey—to challenge myself and skateboard across the country. I thought, “Why not Kanyakumari?” and from there, the plan began to take shape.</p>
            <h1>Convincing Family: </h1>
            <p>The idea of skateboarding across India wasn’t easy to explain, especially to my family. At first, they didn’t take it seriously, assuming I’d return within a day or two. Even after I skated my way to Chandigarh, they were doubtful. It wasn’t until I had been on the road for over a week that they began to realize how serious I was about completing this journey. Of course, safety was a huge concern for them, as traveling alone across India on a skateboard comes with its risks. But once I left, I made it clear that I wasn’t turning back.
            </p>
            <h1>The Route: </h1>
            <p>My original plan was to skate along India’s western coastline, passing through states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Kerala. However, once I hit Patiala, I encountered restrictions preventing skateboards on expressways, which forced me to rethink my route. I quickly adapted and shifted to NH44, India’s longest national highway, which runs from Jammu to Kanyakumari. This new path took me through Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka, adding new dimensions to my journey.</p>
            <h1>Packing and Adjustments: </h1>
            <p>Like any long-distance adventure, packing was a learning curve. Initially, I left with a heavy load—two or three pairs of clothes, my camera, and some other gear. But by the time I reached Kullu, I realized that carrying so much was weighing me down. I decided to send most of my things back home, keeping just the essentials, and continued doing this throughout the trip, picking up new clothes when needed and shipping back whatever I didn’t need.
            </p>
            <h1>Daily Skating Routine: </h1>
            <p>My goal was to cover 40 kilometers every day. However, in rural areas, particularly in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where accommodation was sparse, I had to push myself further, sometimes skating 60 to 70 kilometers in a single day. As I moved into hotter regions, like Maharashtra, I began starting my days as early as 6 am to avoid the intense heat later in the day, making sure I reached my stops by noon.</p>
            <h1>Safety Precautions: </h1>
            <p>Safety was always a priority during my journey. I carried a collapsible stick for protection, especially against stray dogs that would often chase me on the road. I avoided showing off my camera in areas that felt risky, and in more deserted regions, I made sure to be cautious. While I was warned about potential dangers in certain states, I found that most people I encountered were helpful and kind, and none of my belongings were ever stolen.</p>
            <h1>Memorable Encounters: </h1>
            <p>One of the most rewarding parts of my journey was meeting people along the way. From cops who invited me to share meals with them to locals who offered me a place to stay, I made friends in many towns and cities. Madhya Pradesh, where I spent 18 days, became a highlight of the trip despite initial warnings about safety. The warmth and generosity of the people I met there left a lasting impression on me, proving that the kindness of strangers can make even the most challenging journeys worthwhile.</p>
            <h1>A Shift in Perspective:</h1>
            <p>This journey reshaped my view of India and its people. What I had expected to be a risky and difficult adventure turned into a testament to the kindness and hospitality that exists in the most unexpected places. Despite hearing negative stories in the news, I learned that the majority of people I met were genuine, helpful, and eager to make my journey smoother.</p>
