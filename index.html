                    100-day
                    journey. My skateboard and I are cruising from the Himalayan heights of Manali to the southern
                    shores of
                    Kanyakumari, covering around 4000 kilometers. Come along as I soak in the beauty, embrace diverse
                    cultures,
                    and share every thrilling experience. Let's share this amazing journey together!</h2>

                <h1>Journey Details</h1>
                <h2>Starting from the majestic hills of Manali on 1st Jan 2024, I'll be embarking on a daily journey of around 40
                    kilometers,
                    cruising through the heart of India. Over the course of 100 days, my skateboard and I will traverse
                    12
                    states, immersing ourselves in the diverse landscapes and rich cultures that make India truly
                    extraordinary.
                    The states on my route include Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya
                    Pradesh,
                    Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Join me as I explore, adapt, and share
                    the
                    unique experiences each state has to offer!</h2>

        <h1>A Personal Message</h1>
        <h2> I really have no idea how this trip is going to end. Not sure how i'll survive the coming 100 days. I am
            aware of the risks of getting robbed, or getting hit or facing some unfortunate events, in addition to me
            being a cold blooded animal who has serious issues with heat and the fear of dogs chasing me, which i know
            will happen. <br> But what to do can't just sit and watch tv and day dream all my life. But that is also the
            thing that motivates me to break out of my comfort zone, explore the unexplored (atleast by me) parts of
            India, and eventually, venture into other parts of the world. <br> Not my original goal but I also hope to
            inspire others, spread joy through the art of skateboarding, ignite passion, and showcase the sheer
            enjoyment that comes with the sport. <br> Through this expedition, I want to convey the message that no
            dream is
            too big. And everything is possible. And i really hope that soon i can say all this by actually
            accomplishing something and not
            just write on my page.
            <br> <i>P.S. See Daydreaming. Again"</i>
